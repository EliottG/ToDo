Contribution Guide
============

### How to contribute to the project:


- First you'll need to follow the [README](./README.md) to install the project

- Then if you want to add a new Feature on ToDoList, you must create your own branch 

        git branch feature-branch
        git checkout -b feature-branch
        
- When you have finished, push your feature branch to open a Pull Request
   
        git push origin feature-branch
        
- Your pull request will be analysed and will be accepted according to the opinion of the lead developer.

### The convention to follow

- The feature that you want to add must be tested in the folder "tests"
- Your code must respect some PSR's  (201, 204..)
- Your commit message must be clear and understable, so that it will be easier to understand your updates
